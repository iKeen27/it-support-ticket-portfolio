# IT Support Ticket Portfolio (Windows Endpoints)

Sanitized, ticket-style case notes documenting common Windows endpoint incidents and repeatable fixes.  
No client-identifiable information is included.

## What this demonstrates
- Windows 10/11 troubleshooting (hardware & software)
- Driver / connectivity remediation after OS deployment
- Performance and stability improvements
- Event Viewer–based crash triage
- Thermal and fan-curve remediation (hardware + UEFI/BIOS)
- Clear documentation with verification steps

## Structure
- `tickets/` — incident tickets (T001–T007)
- `INDEX.md` — quick navigation

## Notes
- Focus is on built-in Windows methods and repeatable steps.
- Third-party tools are intentionally minimized.
