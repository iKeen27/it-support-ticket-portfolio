# IT Support Ticket Portfolio (Windows Endpoints)

Sanitized, ticket-style case notes documenting common Windows 10/11 endpoint incidents and repeatable fixes.
No client-identifiable information is included.

## What this demonstrates
- Windows 10/11 troubleshooting (hardware + software)
- Post-OS install driver remediation (chipset / NIC / GPU)
- Performance and stability improvements (startup + system responsiveness)
- Event Viewer–based crash triage and corrective actions
- Thermal remediation (repaste + cooler upgrade) and validation under load
- UEFI/BIOS guidance (fan curves) with user-assisted execution
- Clear documentation with verification and prevention steps

## Structure
- `tickets/` — incident tickets (T001–T007)
- `INDEX.md` — quick navigation to tickets

## How to use this repo
1) Start with `INDEX.md`.
2) Open any ticket to see: Impact → Environment → Symptoms → Investigation → Resolution → Verification → Root cause → Prevention.

## Notes
- Focus is on repeatable, support-style workflows.
- Third-party tools are intentionally minimized; priority is built-in Windows and vendor-supported methods.
